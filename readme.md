<strong>Basic Installation and Usage:</strong>

`python PyTube-GUI.py`

<strong>-or-</strong>

Run PyTube-GUI.exe from within it's source directory with a shortcut.

This application relies on ffmpeg as a dependency, therefore ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe must exist alongside PyTube-GUI.py (Usually on system PATH (avaiable from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)).

Make sure to check out the repositories for pytube and pydub, as their functionality extends far beyond this little application.
