<h1>PyTube-GUI</h1>

<strong>Basic Installation and Usage:</strong>

Pydub relies on ffmpeg as a dependency, therefore ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe must exist alongside PyTube-GUI.py (avaiable from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

Make sure to check out the repositories for PyTube and Pydub, as their functionality extends far beyond this little application.
